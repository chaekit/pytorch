# Lazy Tensors Core

Provides infrastructure to connect the [PyTorch deep learning framework](https://pytorch.org/)
to deep learning acelerators, with a focus on training. This project is derived from [PyTorch/XLA](https://github.com/pytorch/xla), which introduced the approach for training on Google TPUs, but instead aims for generality across vendors.

## <a name="API"></a> API & Best Practices

In general, lazy tensors follow PyTorch APIs. Some additional lazy_tensor_core specific APIs are available at:

[Documentation for master branch](https://pytorch.org/ltc/master)

See the [API Guide](API_GUIDE.md) for best practices when writing networks that
run on deep learning accelerators.

## <a name="PerfMetrics"></a> Performance Profiling and Auto-Metrics Analysis

With PyTorch/XLA we provide a set of performance profiling tooling and auto-metrics analysis which you can check the following resources:
* [Official tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/pytorch-xla-performance-profiling) 
* [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/pytorch-xla-profiling-colab.ipynb)
* [Sample MNIST training script with profiling](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/test/test_profile_mp_mnist.py)

## <a name="Troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting

If an accelerator integration using this infrastructure isn't performing as expected,
see the [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md), which has suggestions for
debugging and optimizing your network(s).

## <a name="Feedback"></a> Providing Feedback
